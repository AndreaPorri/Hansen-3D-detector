# Hansen-3D-detector
Detector for matching a 3D model point cloud with a target point cloud. The target point cloud consists of a point cloud contained in a box detected by a YOLOv8 detector. The goal is to verify that what is detetcted in the box by YOLO actually corresponds to a Hansen connector and that its location in space can be identified.
